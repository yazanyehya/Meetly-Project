## üîç Deep Dive: Core Components

### Backend API (FastAPI)

- **Authentication:**  
  - **JWT-based Login/Signup:** Secure access with role‚Äëbased permissions (student vs. professor).
  - **OAuth2PasswordBearer:** Simplifies token management.

- **Data Models:**  
  - **User:** Captures both student and professor profiles.
  - **SlotTime:** Represents available meeting windows.
  - **Meeting:** Links students, professors, and slots.
  - **WaitList:** Manages queued bookings for fully occupied slots.
  - **PreferredTime:** Stores student availability preferences.
  - **RescheduleRequest & Notification:** Handle multi‚Äëparty swap workflows and alert users of changes.

- **Matching Engine:**  
  - **Bipartite Graph Construction:** Maps students to their preferred slots.
  - **DFS & BFS Algorithms:**  
    - **DFS (`_find_augmenting_path`):** Finds augmenting paths to maximize matching.
    - **BFS (`try_single_user_bfs_in_memory`):** Efficiently seeks the shortest path for waitlisted students.
  - These algorithms ensure optimal assignment and minimal disruptions.

### Frontend (NiceGUI + FullCalendar)

- **NiceGUI Components:**  
  - **Login/Signup Pages:** Elegant, responsive pages built entirely in Python.
  - **Calendar Dashboard:** A dynamic calendar view that aggregates available and booked slots.
  - **Modals & Dialogs:** Custom dialogs for creating slots, booking meetings, setting preferences, and managing notifications.
  - **LocalStorage Integration:** Persists JWT tokens, user roles, and IDs for secure API calls.

- **FullCalendar Integration:**  
  - **Interactive Views:** Month view that display real‚Äëtime booking data.
  - **Event Handling:** Date click actions trigger modal dialogs for slot creation or meeting booking.
  - **Live Updates:** JavaScript functions seamlessly refresh events after any changes.

## ü§ñ Matching Algorithms: A Closer Look

### **Depth‚ÄëFirst Search (DFS) for Augmenting Paths**

- **Purpose:** To find a sequence of alternating unmatched and matched edges (an *augmenting path*) that can free up a slot for a student.
- **Process:**
  1. **For each preferred slot of a student:**  
     - If the slot is free, assign it immediately.
     - If occupied, recursively try to move the current occupant to another slot.
  2. **If the path is found:**  
     - Update the `slot_to_user` mapping along the path.
- **Benefit:** Maximizes the overall matching, ensuring more students get a slot.

### **Breadth‚ÄëFirst Search (BFS) for Single‚ÄëUser Optimization**

- **Purpose:** To quickly find the shortest augmenting path for a single waitlisted student.
- **Process:**
  1. **Start from the waitlisted student:**  
     - Explore their preferred slots.
  2. **Alternate between students and slots:**  
     - Track the path using a predecessor map.
  3. **When a free slot is found:**  
     - Reconstruct the path and update assignments.
- **Benefit:** Minimizes the number of swaps needed, providing a quick, fair solution for individual cases.
